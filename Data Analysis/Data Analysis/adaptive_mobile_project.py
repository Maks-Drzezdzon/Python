Questions:
1) Which considerations can you make about the input data? 
    # i have no idea ? check it conforms to a pattern ?
    If the file size is big (letâ€™s say 20GB), how would store it? 
    # it depends on what kind of data it is, database with relations
    # compress it
    
    Would you keep the original format? If not, what would you do? 
    
    Could you describe different options/format for storing the data? 
    
    Which sanity checks would you apply and why?
    
    
    
5) Let us suppose we don't want duplicated "ID"s. In case there are rows 
   with duplicated IDs we just keep the first row we've found: how would you 
   extract a file, from the original one, without duplicated IDs?
   
6) How would you create a new file where the "Datetime" column is substituted
    with a "Timestamp" column with the (Unix) timestamp in milliseconds?
    i.e., for the example above you would have:
        
ID,Timestamp,SourceType,DestinationType,MessageType
723649,1520793122.321,ES-010,DS-020,PK_723_AB
184734,1509613424.524,ES-201,DS-173,PK_163_RF
631838,1516401757.183,ES-150,DS-155,PK_126_RP

7) How would you create a simple count of the distinct "SourceType"s? 
    i.e. we want to see each distinct "SourceType", with the number
    of times it appears in the file, sorted by descending number of occurencies.
